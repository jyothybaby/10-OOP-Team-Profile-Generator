<b># 10-OOP-Team-Profile-Generator</b><br>
    Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so youâ€™ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

Works i have done for this project:
1. Created the repository in the GitHub and cloned in to the local machine
2. Created .gitignore file using "touch .gitignore" command
3. Run some commands in the cmd prompt for installing the dependencies,
    * npm init
    * npm install inquirer
    * npm install jest
4. Updated .gitignore file with two contents, node_modules/ and .DS_Store - node_module and .DS_Store will not uploaded in to the github.
5. In this project there are two .js file: Index.js and htmlTemplateFile.js - Index.js contains all the questions and functions to write the answers to the dynamically creating file (index.html). htmlTemplateFile.js contains the Markdown Template for the index.html file.
6. Before running the command, check the present working directory (PWD).In command line, if we are not in the exact folder, then the application will throw an error.
7. For running the unit test,  type "npm run test" in the command line prompt. Attached the screenshots for the review.
8. For creating the team, type node index.js" in the command line.
